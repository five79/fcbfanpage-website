      <h3>The owner</h3>
      <p>Barcelona was started by a swiss man in the 1899 and is currently one of the most recognised and prestigious clubs of all time,</p>
      <p>It was started by a man called Joan Gamper and his 10 friends</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>20th Century</h3>
      <p>The first symbol was the same as the town symbol but in 1906 the first vlub symbol was made, though there are different variations over the years the general logo stayed the same.</p>
      <p>On December 8th 1899, Barca played their very first match. In 1902 Barca had won their very first trophy, the Copa Macaya.</p>
	  <p>In 1910 they had won the Copa del Rey for the first time. The team had played in the stadium Les Corts in May 1922, they had played in this stadium for 35 years.</p>
	  <p>The owner had died on July 30 1930, and the club was going through a very difficult time due to the political conditions in the country. This went on for 10 years</p>
	  <p>In 1949 the club had celebrated its 50th anniversary, by this time they had won 21 Catalan championships, 9 cups and 4 spanish league titles.</p>
	  <p>In 1950 arrived Kubala, a huge talent, who lead Barca to one of the most successful seasons in their history. He retired in 1961</p>
	  <p>In 1957 the club opened the doors to one of the most known stadium in the world the Camp Nou.<p/>
	  <p>In 1973 Johan Cruyff had joined Barca who lead them to win the league in the 73-74 season. He left in 1978 but came back as a manager in 1987 and left in 1996. During this time he had lead Barca to their very first Champions league title.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>21st Century</h3>
      <p>In 2000 Joan Gaspart became the president of the club and so began the longest time we had without any titles and so he resigned in 2004 and Joan Laporta had won the election and became the clubs president.</p>
      <p>In 2003 Ronaldinho was signed, this signing was very important to the club as helped to transform this club into a winning team and he lead us to winning the champions league in 2006. Unfortunately, due to his partying nature he was kicked from the club and joined AC Milan.</p>
	  <p>In 2004 Lionel Messi had made his debut for Barcelona, he became the most important player for Barca for over 15 years.</p>
	  <p>In 2008 Pep Guardiola had become the coach for Barca. Pep had begun to revolutionize the club as he had changed the way they played and this change became the basis of the clubs tactic for many years. Using his tactics he was able to win 2 champions leagues, 3 laligas,2 uefa supercups,3 spanish supercups, 2 club world cups and 2 Copa del Rey in only 4 years.</p>
	  <p>Once Pep had left the team continued to win domestically but had no european success, until they had signed Neymar in 2014 and Suarez in 2015 and thus a legandary trio was born. This trio under the guidance of manager Luis Enrique went on to win a treble, becoming the only team at the time to have won 2 trebles.</p>
	  <p>The president of the club in 2014 was Josep Maria Bartomeu, someone who is hated by all Barca fans</p>
	  <p>Both Luis Enrique and Neymar had left in 2017 and unfortunately since then although Barcelona have enjoyed domestic success, the same cannot be said for European success.So Barca have gone through many different managers with no european success.</p>
	  <p>And so Ernesto Valverde was bought on as manager, he had won 2 laligas in 17/18 and 18/19, he was replaced in Jan 2020 by Real Betis coach Quique Setien</p>
	  <p>Setien ended the season with no trophies and so was replaced by former Barca player Ronald Koeman. Koeman had forced out Suarez from the club and only won a Spanish supercup and so was forced from the club</p>
	  <p>President Bartomeu diverted money from Barca for his own personal use, leaving the club penniless which caused Messi to leave due to ffp. Bartomeu handed in his resignation and Laporta was brought back.</p>
	  <p>Laporta bought Xavi, a club legend, to manage and he had a laliga in the 22/23 season, the first since 2019.</p>
	  <p>Under Laporta the club has won 14 trophies and is still going strong.</p>
